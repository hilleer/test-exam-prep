# Test case design

- Test case design (week 3)

- Point out the main differences between white box and block box tests


- List a few of the elements that a high quality test case in your opinion is comprised of


- Elaborate on the role of oracles and their usage with regards to test cases 


- Explain the overall focus and important considerations in relation to the test analysis process


- Explain what has to be done during the test design process and what the result of it is


- Explain which tasks to carry out and decisions to take in the test implementation process


- Account for some general aspects concerned with test (design / case / procedure) documentation


- Describe how the techniques equivalence partitioning and boundary value analysis are applied in test case design and outline the reasons for using each technique 


- Describe the benefits of decision tables and state transition models in the context of test case design




---

* Demonstrate your solution to the study point exercise "Test Case Design"
	- You should (as a minimum):
	- Explain how you have designed your different test cases
	- Explain which equivalence partitions and boundary values your test cases entail, plus why you have chosen these specifically
	- Account for any open boundaries in your test cases 
	- Demonstrate if you have chosen a two or three value approach in your boundary value analysis
	- Demonstrate how a decision table is created and used in your test case
