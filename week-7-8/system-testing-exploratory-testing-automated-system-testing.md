* What is the difference between System and Acceptance testing
* Discuss Pros and Cons with manual versus automated tests
* Explain about Mike Cohn's Test Pyramid and why it's relevant for test planning
* Discuss some of the problems with automated GUI tests and what makes such test "vulnerable" 
* Explain about the Selenium, its purpose, and how it "fits into" the testing world
* Demonstrate, using practical examples, how you have tested Web-UI's using Selenium.
* Explain the difference between a Headless browser, versus a GUI-based browser, and the pros & cons of each
* Explain the problems we face when testing modern AJAX/JavaScript applications and demonstrate, using practical examples, how you have solved them
