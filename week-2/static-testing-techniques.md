**_Demonstrate your solution to the study point exercise "Static Testing Techniques"_**

* You should:
	- Demonstrate how your Triangle code follows the coding standards defined in your development tool
	- Demonstrate the central code metrics for your Triangle program in your development tool
	- Explain what to do if your tool reports poor metrics results for your code (e.g. cyclomatic complexity)
	- List the best practices and code conventions that you find most important for a team to follow and that should be put into a coding standard document
